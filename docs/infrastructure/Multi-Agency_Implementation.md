# 🏢 NurseOS Multi-Agency Implementation Guide

This guide documents the step-by-step implementation of multi-agency support in NurseOS v2.

## 📋 Implementation Overview

We've successfully transformed NurseOS from a single-agency system to a multi-agency platform where nurses can work across hospitals, SNFs, home health agencies, and staffing companies.

## 🗂️ Files Created/Updated

## 🚀 Migration Process

### **Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)**
1. Deploy new models and repositories
2. Test with mock data
3. Ensure backward compatibility

### **Phase 2: Migration (Week 2)**
1. Run `AgencyMigrationService.runMigration()`
2. Validate data integrity
3. Test agency switching

### **Phase 3: Production (Week 3)**
1. Update Firestore security rules
2. Deploy router changes
3. Train users on agency selection

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### **Data Isolation**
```javascript
// Firestore rule example
match /agencies/{agencyId}/patients/{patientId} {
  allow read, write: if hasAgencyAccess(agencyId);
}
```

### **Access Control**
- Users can only access agencies where they have active roles
- Patient data is completely isolated by agency
- Cross-agency XP remains user-level

## 🧭 User Experience Flow

### **New User Journey**
1. User signs in → No agencies → Shows "No agencies" message
2. Admin assigns user to agency → User can access data
3. User with multiple agencies → Agency selection screen

### **Existing User Journey**
1. Migration runs → All users assigned to "default_agency"
2. User continues normal workflow
3. Admin can later assign to additional agencies

## 📊 Data Structure

### **Before Migration**
```
users/{uid} → { name, role, xp, badges }
patients/{id} → { name, mrn, ... }
```

### **After Migration**
```
users/{uid} → { 
  name, role, 
  activeAgencyId: "default_agency",
  agencyRoles: {
    "default_agency": { role: "nurse", department: "ICU" }
  }
}
agencies/default_agency/patients/{id} → { name, mrn, agencyId, ... }
```

## 🔧 Developer Usage

### **Getting Current Agency Context**
```dart
final agencyId = ref.watch(agencyContextNotifierProvider);
final patients = ref.watch(patientListProvider); // Auto-scoped to agency
```

### **Switching Agencies**
```dart
await ref.read(agencyContextNotifierProvider.notifier)
    .switchAgency('hospital_123');
```

### **Checking Permissions**
```dart
if (user.hasAccessToAgency('hospital_123')) {
  // User can access this agency's data
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### **Unit Tests**
- Test agency context provider
- Test repository scoping
- Test migration logic

### **Integration Tests**
- Test agency switching workflow
- Test data isolation
- Test permission enforcement

### **User Acceptance Tests**
- Nurse can switch between agencies
- Patient data stays isolated
- XP accumulates across agencies

## 🚨 Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Immediate**: Revert router changes
2. **Short-term**: Disable agency selection screen
3. **Long-term**: Run migration rollback script

## 📈 Success Metrics

- ✅ Zero data loss during migration
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Agency switching works smoothly
- ✅ Security rules prevent cross-agency access
- ✅ Performance remains acceptable

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### **Phase 2 Features**
- Cross-agency reporting for admins
- Agency-specific branding/themes
- Inter-agency patient transfers
- Agency-specific workflows

### **Phase 3 Features**
- Agency marketplace (find work)
- Cross-agency scheduling
- Agency performance analytics
- Multi-agency billing

## 🏥 Agency Types Supported

| Type | Description | Use Cases |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Hospital | Acute care facilities | ICU, ED, Med-Surg units |
| SNF | Skilled nursing facilities | Long-term care, rehab |
| Home Health | In-home care agencies | Visiting nurses, home visits |
| Agency | Staffing companies | Travel nurses, per-diem |
| Clinic | Outpatient clinics | Family practice, specialists |
| Other | Custom facilities | Research, specialty care |

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

**User can't see any agencies**
- Check if user has been assigned agency roles
- Verify agency is marked as active

**Data not loading**
- Ensure agency context is set
- Check Firestore security rules

**Migration failed**
- Run validation script
- Check logs for specific errors
- Use rollback if necessary

### **Debug Commands**
```dart
// Check user's agency status
final user = ref.read(authControllerProvider).value;
print('Active agency: ${user?.activeAgencyId}');
print('Agency roles: ${user?.agencyRoles}');

// Check migration status
final migrationService = AgencyMigrationService(FirebaseFirestore.instance);
final isComplete = await migrationService.isMigrationComplete();
print('Migration complete: $isComplete');
```
